**SWIFT payments** are international money transfers made through the **Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)** network. This system enables secure and standardized transactions between banks and financial institutions across different countries. SWIFT is one of the most widely used systems for cross-border payments.

### Key Features of SWIFT Payments:

1. **SWIFT Network**:
   - SWIFT does not transfer money itself but facilitates communication between banks to process international transactions. 
   - Banks and financial institutions use the SWIFT network to send payment orders to each other, specifying the details of the transaction.

2. **SWIFT Code (BIC)**:
   - Each bank participating in the SWIFT network has a unique **SWIFT code** or **Bank Identifier Code (BIC)**, which is an 8- or 11-character code that identifies the specific bank and its branch.
   - Example: "HDFCINBBXXX" where "HDFC" is the bank code, "IN" is the country code (India), "BB" is the location code, and "XXX" is the branch code.

3. **Process of SWIFT Payments**:
   - **Initiation**: The sender requests a transfer from their bank (the remitting bank).
   - **Message Transmission**: The remitting bank sends a SWIFT message to the recipient’s bank (the beneficiary bank) via the SWIFT network.
   - **Intermediary Banks**: If the two banks do not have a direct relationship, the payment may go through one or more intermediary banks, often known as correspondent banks.
   - **Settlement**: The recipient’s bank credits the beneficiary's account once all intermediary steps are complete.

4. **SWIFT Payment Types**:
   - **MT103**: A standard SWIFT message format for making international customer payments, which provides a detailed transaction report.
   - **MT202**: Used for bank-to-bank payments, often for fund transfers between banks.
   - **MT202 COV**: A message format that includes cover payments associated with MT103 messages, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.

5. **Fees**:
   - SWIFT payments involve several fees, including charges from the sender's bank, intermediary banks, and the recipient's bank.
   - These fees can be deducted from the transfer amount (shared charges) or paid entirely by the sender or recipient.

6. **Processing Time**:
   - SWIFT payments typically take **1-5 business days** to process, depending on the number of intermediary banks involved, currency conversion, and time zones.

7. **Security**:
   - The SWIFT network is highly secure and uses encryption to ensure that the payment instructions are sent securely and accurately.

### Key Information Required for a SWIFT Payment:
To make a SWIFT payment, the following details are usually required:
- **Recipient’s Name and Address**.
- **Recipient Bank’s Name and Address**.
- **Recipient Bank’s SWIFT/BIC Code**.
- **Recipient’s Bank Account Number (IBAN in some countries)**.
- **Payment Amount and Currency**.
- **Purpose of Payment** (sometimes required for regulatory compliance).

### Advantages and Disadvantages of SWIFT Payments:

**Advantages**:
- Widely accepted and secure for international payments.
- Supports multiple currencies.
- Provides a detailed transaction trail.

**Disadvantages**:
- Higher fees compared to other international payment methods (like SEPA in Europe or real-time payments).
- Slower processing time due to the involvement of multiple banks.
- Exchange rate margins may add extra costs.

----------
A **Nostro account** is an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank, typically to facilitate international transactions and settlements. The term "Nostro" means "ours" in Italian, indicating "our account in your books." It is used primarily by banks to manage foreign exchange and international trade. Nostro accounts allow banks to carry out operations like foreign exchange transactions, remittances, and trade finance by maintaining foreign currency balances with correspondent banks abroad.
