File Size Example
	•	How much text fits?
	•	128,000 tokens ≈ 90,000–100,000 words (1 token ≈ 0.75 words in English).
	•	For plain text, 1 character ≈ 1 byte. An average English word (with space/punctuation) ≈ 5.5 characters.
	•	100,000 words × 5.5 = 550,000 bytes = ~550KB (plain text, UTF-8 encoding).
	•	So: You can inject approximately 500–600KB of plain text into Llama 3.2 using either method, just like with Phi-3
